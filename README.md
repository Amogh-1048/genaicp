## Problem Statement
Transforming Monet-style paintings into realistic images using CycleGAN, aiming to enhance the model's output quality, focusing on achieving detailed and lifelike results in artistic-to-realistic image translation.

## Training
The model has been trained on monet images as dataset to convert them into realistic photos and realistic photos as dataset to convert them into monet images
untitled30.ipynb contains the code for training the model

## Steps to run inference.ipynb
1. Upload the two datasets to the colab environment.
2. Run untitled30.ipynb file.
